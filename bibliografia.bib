  abstract = {
    This paper reviews some of the difficulties that arise in the verification
    of kernelized secure systems and suggests new techniques for their
    resolution. It is proposed that secure systems should be conceived as
    distributed systems in which security is achieved partly through the
    physical separation of its individual components and partly through the
    mediation of trusted functions performed within some of those components.
    The purpose of a security kernel is simply to allow such a 'distributed'
    system to actually run within a single processor; policy enforcement is
    not the concern of a security kernel. This approach decouples verification
    of components which perform trusted functions from verification of the
    security kernel. This latter task may be accomplished by a new 
    verification technique called 'proof of separability' which explicitly 
    addresses the security relevant aspects of interrupt handling and other 
    issues ignored by present methods.
